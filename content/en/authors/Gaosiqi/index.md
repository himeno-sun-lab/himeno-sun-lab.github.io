# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I graduated from the Department of English at PolyU, where I majored in English linguistics. I also studied psychology at both PolyU and UCLA. While at PolyU, I participated in psycholinguistics and developmental neurolinguistics projects, ranging from EDA and ERP to fMRI. Additionally, I briefly worked as an NLP and NLG product manager for an AI voice assistant at an AI company, where I was introduced to the concepts of Large Language Models and Computational Neural Science.

My primary interest lies in understanding the similarities and differences between how the human brain and neural networks process syntactic and semantic information. Currently, I am working with Dr. Teng Xiangbin on decoding/encoding hippocampal semantic representations of spatial and temporal information.
