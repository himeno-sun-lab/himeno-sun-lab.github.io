Our Kiban-B project aims to address the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing volume of medical data by employing cutting-edge artificial intelligence and multimodal fusion technologies. The goal is to provide innovative solutions and significant contributions to medical analysis. The project focuses on three primary research areas: developing deeply interpretable models for medical imaging, designing generative networks to enhance medical image synthesis, and advancing multimodal diagnostic approaches for Parkinson's disease.

To achieve these goals, the project leverages state-of-the-art neural network technologies, including prototype-based networks, diffusion models, and tensor fusion techniques. By integrating these advanced methodologies, we aim to develop deep learning models that are not only more powerful and efficient but also user-friendly for medical professionals. These models are expected to facilitate better decision-making, improve diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately contribute to more effective and personalized patient care. Through this interdisciplinary effort, the Kiban-B project seeks to bridge the gap between AI research and practical medical applications, fostering a future where technology and healthcare are seamlessly connected.
